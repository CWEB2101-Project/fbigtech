          <h1><a href type="button" class="btn btn-primary" btn-lg btn-block>Our personal data is constantly being mined and sold. As the saying goes, “If you’re 
            not paying for the product, then you are the product.” <br><br>Big tech is taking our data and monetizing it by selling it to advertisers. That has been their 
            business model for a very long time, and they’ve grown exponentially abusive with control over our everyday lives. We accept this as truth! These same 
            predators are also psychologically conditioning our children to grow up accepting this screen consumerism as their reality as well. <br><br>The problem isn’t 
            collecting or analyzing data through sophisticated algorithms, it’s who benefits from the use of these technologies. We should have the power to use the 
            same data analytics that big tech uses against us within these apps so that we may reap the same rewards they do. Unfortunately, it’s all hidden behind 
            watered-down online videos, trial periods of big brand name ecosystems where you lose all privacy, paywalls of endless courseware programs, or years of 
            expensive academic endeavors.<br><br>There needs to be a simpler and more private solution to utilize your data and achieve your personal and financial goals.
